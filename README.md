# papers-I-read

Inspired by [@shagunsodhani](https://github.com/shagunsodhani), I am trying a new initiative - a-paper-a-week. This repository will hold all those papers and related summaries and notes.

## List of papers

* [Never Ending Learning](https://gist.github.com/Prakhar0409/f72a2780e5e567081bb61dd843fc61bc)
* [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters](https://gist.github.com/Prakhar0409/18d4af9671a7484358bbd12615d2c796)
